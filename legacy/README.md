## legacy directory
This directory contains the old version of infinite_scrape, in bits and pieces. The goal was for me to understand how to get this all to work. Go to the [backend directory for the functional versions of this code.](https://github.com/quantumbagel/infinite_scrape/tree/master/backend)

this is a fun project
